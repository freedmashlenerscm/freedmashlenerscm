Consumer finance companies offer installment loans in 44 states to borrowers who usually have low credit scores.2 Although allowable finance charges vary significantly across these states,3 prices for these loans are generally higher than banks or credit unions charge customers with higher credit scores. Installment loans range from about $100 to more than $10,000, are repayable in four to 60 monthly installments, and can either be secured—meaning the borrower provides collateral, such as an automobile title or personal property—or unsecured.4 The market is split into lenders who primarily issue small loans, under $1,500, and those that mostly offer large loans.5

Approximately 14,000 consumer finance stores operate nationally, about half of which are owned by the 20 largest national lenders.6 The nation’s largest consumer finance company operates more than 1,800 branches in 44 states.7 These national lenders offer small loans in 18 states,8 while large loans are available across all 44 states that allow installment lending. In general, Southern states tend to allow higher prices and have more stores per capita. (See Figure 1 and Appendix A.) An estimated 10 million people spend more than $10 billion annually for these loans.9 These figures do not include installment loans issued by payday or auto title lenders, which are multipayment loans issued at much higher prices than the traditional installment loans described in this report.
